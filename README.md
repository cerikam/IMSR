# Example Integral REactor for Nuclear Education (EIRENE) 

EIRENE is an non-proprietary reactor model somewhat resembling the IMSR-400 design of Terrestrial Energy Inc. https://aris.iaea.org/PDF/IMSR400.pdf

*Eirene* is a Greek goddess of Peace and the season of spring, a keeper of the gates of heaven along with her sisters Eunomia (Good Order) and Dike (Justice). (Hesiod, The Works and Days, verse 225)

# Description of subdirectories:
* EIRENE: Contains source model files for the EIRENE SCALE 6.3.1 model, including KENO-VI inputs for running neutronics analyses (critical uranium search and fuel and isothermal temperature feedback coefficient analyses); TRITON inputs for depletion analyses (both with and without Sourdough refueling); SHIFT inputs for generating .h5 files from neutronic analyses; and nuclide vector data collected at each depletion step with the Sourdough refueling simulations using different refuel salt enrichment levels.
